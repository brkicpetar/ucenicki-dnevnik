# Učenički Dnevnik (Student Diary)

*Modern technologies which are supposed to facilitate the learning process of young people, have become an integral part of everyday education. The challenge for learners today, however, is the true flood of information they are confronted with and which they must master to filter efficiently in order to remain successful. This can lead to chaos and disorganization amongst young people. The goal of this paper is therefore to minimize the effects of this negative development through modern technologies, and thus to simplify a students day with an efficient software solution. In the course of the paper, a software, which has the goal to make the many small notes on which students record their timetables, work tasks, received grades, calculated grade point averages, etc. obsolete. All this will be available through an application called 'Student Diary', just at your fingertips.* - Abstract of the provided paper.


This software solution has been finished back in 2019. It was a project for **"Regional Talent Centre - Belgrade" Competition**.

In this repository you can find a paper which explains all the details about this software solution. There are two files: one in **English, in Latin script**, and one in **Serbian, in cyrillic script**.
